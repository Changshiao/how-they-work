NOTE:
The joined json file DOES NOT included about 5,000 repetitive web skimmer breaches under their own sub-directory in 'data/json'.  While they are legitimate breaches, they were discovered by script all at once and will therefore bias the dataset.  You can include that data by  using the -r argument with the vcdb_to_joined.py script.  If you use do, I recommend normalizing that portion of the data.
